With a strong academic foundation in Micro Science and an MBA in Marketing from the State of Maharashtra, I bring over 16 years of diverse experience in retail operations and product marketing across both national and international markets. My journey has been shaped by working with globally recognized organizations and learning from dynamic business environments.  

From the very beginning, my purpose has been clear—to ensure that farmers receive fair returns for the hard work they invest in cultivating their produce. Growing up in Beed, in the drought-prone Marathwada region, I witnessed firsthand the resilience and struggles of farming communities. These early experiences continue to fuel my determination to create meaningful market opportunities not only within India but also across the globe.  

With this vision, I joined hands with Mr. Naser Khan and Mr. Sayed Furkhan to establish Smell Feast Food Processing & Packaging Pvt. Ltd., a company founded on the values of quality, sustainability, and farmer empowerment.  

Today, through Smell Feast Food Processing & Packaging Pvt. Ltd., we are committed to connecting Indian farmers with international markets, uplifting rural livelihoods, and building a global symbol of trust, excellence, and innovation in fresh produce.
